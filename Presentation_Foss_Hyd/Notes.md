Gitea is a powerful open-source, self-hosted Git platform that offers a great alternative to other Git services. In my talk, I covered everything from installation to advanced features, including:

Gitea Actions: In parity with GitHub Actions, Gitea Actions allows you to automate your software development workflows directly within your Git repository.

Single Sign-On with GitHub: This feature makes it easy to manage access to your Gitea instance if your team already uses GitHub accounts.
Support for Passkeys: Gitea's support for passkeys provides an additional layer of security for your Git repository. Single sign-on (SSO) simplifies managing access control, especially when you're juggling a lot of infrastructure.

Gitea Documentaion can be found here: https://docs.gitea.com/

In my presentation, I also highlighted that my Gitea instance is hosted on a DigitalOcean virtual private server. If you're interested in trying DigitalOcean yourself, you can use this referral signup link to get started: https://lnkd.in/gzGU3_MN
